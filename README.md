## About

Michiru is a bot created by Krazyunderground and Saoul. It is a fun, economy, and slight moderation bot. The source code is <em>mostly</em> available here to use as a reference if you want to make your own bot. Please see [Usage](##-Usage) for more information before copying/using the source code.

Push notes work as follows,  
\- for removed  
\+ for added  
% for changed  
\# for updated

## Usage
Although the source code is free to download and use, we ask that you do not use it as a competitor. We also ask that you edit the bot to make it unique. The bot will not work out of the box, and is meant to simply be a reference if you get stuck somewhere. There is also a lot of complex systems and functions in place to help the bot run. If you do not understand them, editing them will break the bot. If you have any questions, or want to know more about how to use the source code, please ask us in the support server.
